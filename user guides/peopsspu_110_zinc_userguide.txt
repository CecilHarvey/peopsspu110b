Overview of all the features in this spu plugin (win32 only)


Changing any of these settings can break the plugin.
It's your responsibility to learn how to repair or not use those options.


Rename plugin to sound.znc


=====================================
========= General Settings

>> Driver
- Method the sound card uses to stream output data

0- DSound = preferred for XP (best card timing)
1- XAudio2 = preferred for Vista / Win 7 (can use for XP but poorer timing)
2- XAudio2 5.1 upmix = converts data to pseudo-5.1 format
3- XAudio2 7.1 upmix = converts data to pseudo-7.1 format



>> Volume
- Lets you control the overall amount of sound output.

- Only works with sound effects! Not QSound music.
Range: 0-20



>> Reverb
- Different modules for the reverberation engine (echos, bass)

0- None = fastest, no quality (may break games)
1- Simple = Pete's mode that does basic emulation (okay)
2- PSX reverb = Neill's formula that comes the closest to a real PSX



>> Interpolation
- Controls how the VAG voice samples are upsampled to 44.1 KHz output rate

0- None = raw sample data (least realistic)
1- Simple = Eternal-type filtering (okay, doesn't work so well with special sound effects)
2- Gaussian = psx default (preferred, can be 'blurry' but is 'centered')
3- 4-tap FIR = old Xebra algorithm (mix of Simple + Gaussian)
4- Cubic = heightens the treble (more highs)
5- Hermite = tries to boost bass/treble in a 'balanced' way
6- Catmull-Rom = big bass/treble booster (can shred voices like Valkyrie Profile)
7- Catmull-Rom (desharp) = medium bass/treble booster (can shred sound effects)



>> Reverb boost
- Turns up the amount of audible reverb for more bass, special effects

(optional, user preference)




=====================================
========= Advanced Settings

>> Latency
- Controls the audio lag / response time


Basically how long does it take for you to hear the audio data.
Higher values can pad FPS dips from streaming cdrom data or slower HDDs.


Each audio card responds differently to this. Unpredictable.
Lower values can cause crackling or distortion.
Play around with it to find a value you like. And your card accepts.



>> Output filter 1
- Frequency response lets the data behave differently based on frequency

(not recommended but good if you want super highs in your audio)



>> Output filter 2
- Lets you change the texture of the final output stream

(depends on how you want your audio to sound)
ex. Gaussian (interp) + Catmull-rom desharp = less blurry, retains original flavor but more bass/treble

Choose whatever strength you want - higher = more stronger effect.



>> Volume - Voices
- Lets you adjust the voices channel separately (higher, lower, normal)

(usually sound effects, lower-quality speech, chip-generated music)





=====================================
========= Expert Settings

WARNING:
Messing around with any of these values can really break your experience.

Delete file to regenerate default settings.



In your plugins folder, you'll see 'spuPeopsSound_expert.ini'

More importantly, you can pause the emu and tweak any of the values in the ini files.
Continue the emu and usually the effects will show up immediately.

Sometimes an emu restart is needed to gain the full FPS advantage.



>> Version
- Extra settings may change often, which will force a default rewrite of values



>> LatencyTarget
- If you have a specific 'base latency' value in mind, you can set it here to override the GUI

- It's just a _request_ amount and not an exact science in practice
Range: 0-200
Range: -1 (ignore this value)



>> UploadTimer
- How long in ms the sound card buffer gets uploaded

- Different sound cards behave very differntly to this (pops, crackling, stuttering, distortion)
> Laptops tend to be 1-2 ms
> Fast cards use 2-10 ms
> Slow ones use 10-30 ms


- Higher the value, less stable your latency will be
(especially important for on-demand streaming, may pad with a higher latency though)

- Lower values tend to be the ideal

Range: 0-50



>> SoundStretcher
- Allows the output to be randomly padded in the middle of streams

- Mainly if you have latency / upload streaming problems and don't mind a little extra data

Range: 0-1



>> APUcycles
- Controls how often the spu generates data
- (*) User decision

- Lower values mean better. But requires lots more cpu power.
- Default usually works with most emus since they call the spu at that speed anyway

- Emus like ePSXe_shark 170 call the spu faster and can handle lower values like '22' or '10'
- Result tends to be better Squaresoft sound effects (ex. Final Fantasy Tactics) or Vib Ribbon

Range: 1-50



>> ReverbTarget
- You can override the amount of reverb strength with this value
- Default = 33

Range: 0-100
Range: -1 (ignore this value)
